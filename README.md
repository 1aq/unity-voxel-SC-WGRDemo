# SC-WGRDemo
Unity playground for voxel world generation / rendering.  
(Early development xD)

2021-09-24: Updated to Unity HDRP. (Partially done, this is only `Scenes/MoonlightForest.unity`)

## Environments
Only tested under:
* Windows 10
* Unity 2021.1.11
* 3950X / RTX 2080s
* DirectX 11  

It probably won't work (efficiently) for Graphics APIs other than DX11 ...

Disclaimer: some (SDF-based) generation stuffs (e.g. hashes, some voronoi stuffs etc.) are borrowed from shadertoy posts; some missing sources will be commented later ... sry
